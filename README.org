#+title: Advent of Code 2021 in Common Lisp

* Disclaimer

It's a learning project, so the solutions may be lacking some mastery.

* Prerequisites

Evaluation of the code assumes =sbcl= and =quicklisp= installed and available.

To use =get_input= script, file =env.lisp= must be created with contents like:

#+begin_example lisp
(defconstant *token* "your-aoc-session-cookie")
#+end_example

The code in =dayNN.lisp= files is written with assumption that it's being evaluated in Emacs with =sly= connection.

* Solutions

|--------+------------------------------------|
| [[https://gitlab.com/pkaznowski/aoc-2021-clisp/-/blob/master/01.lisp][Day 1]]  | =reduce= (would be better with =loop=) |
| [[https://gitlab.com/pkaznowski/aoc-2021-clisp/-/blob/master/02.lisp][Day 2]]  | loop with accumulating values      |
| [[https://gitlab.com/pkaznowski/aoc-2021-clisp/-/blob/master/03.lisp][Day 3]]  | rotating a list and recursion      |
| [[https://gitlab.com/pkaznowski/aoc-2021-clisp/-/blob/master/04.lisp][Day 4]]  | like day 3, but more looping       |
